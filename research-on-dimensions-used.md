## Updated Research on Theoretical Foundations of the Five Dimensions

Recent research in 2024–2025 has produced a range of studies updating, integrating, or refining the frameworks underlying the five dimensions you describe: affective, cognitive, relational, temporal, and behavioral. Below is a synthesis of the most current findings relevant to each theoretical foundation.

### Affective Dimension — Terror Management and Positive Psychology

A comprehensive 2025 meta-analysis by Arendsen and colleagues examined **Terror Management Theory (TMT)** across consumer and social psychology, finding mixed empirical support and substantial methodological heterogeneity. Another 2025 large-scale reanalysis (“R.I.P. Terror Management”) concluded that much of the earlier TMT research may have suffered from publication bias but identified a small subset of studies with valid mortality-salience effects. Current interest has shifted toward **meaning-regulation and existential resilience**, integrating TMT with Positive Psychology approaches that focus on meaning-making and compassion as adaptive responses to mortality anxiety.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

### Cognitive Dimension — System Justification and Cognitive Dissonance

Recent reassessments of **System Justification Theory (SJT)** reaffirm that individuals often rationalize social and political systems when change feels impossible, aligning with the dissonance-reduction mechanisms described by Festinger. Current theoretical work emphasizes **motivated reasoning under uncertainty**: people justify existing systems not only to reduce cognitive tension but to maintain a sense of predictability and control in collapsing or unstable environments. Cross-cultural work continues to test how these processes vary between individualist and collectivist societies.[^5][^6][^7]

### Relational Dimension — Social Identity and Cultural Risk Theory

A 2024 study by Chassang and colleagues synthesized **Cultural Theory of Risk** and the **psychometric paradigm**, showing that risk perception depends heavily on cultural values mediating dread, perceived benefits, and the number of people affected. New models explain how **worldview alignment within social groups** shapes both emotional and behavioral responses to hazards. Complementary research in 2025 explores **social identity processes** in consumer decision-making, confirming that collective identity and belonging influence resilience and adaptive action under systemic stress.[^8][^9]

### Temporal Dimension — Holling’s Adaptive Cycle and Panarchy

Recent applications of the **Panarchy framework (2025)** describe complex adaptive systems in terms of cyclical phases—exploitation (r), conservation (K), release (ω), and reorganization (α)—working across nested scales. These models provide predictive insight into **collapse–renewal dynamics** in socio-ecological and organizational contexts. The **adaptive cycle** continues to evolve as both a metaphor and mathematical model linking local and global transformations across time frames. Such work increasingly informs sustainability science and anticipatory governance, emphasizing temporal awareness in decision-making.[^10][^11][^12]

### Behavioral Dimension — Self-Efficacy and Behavioral Adaptation

New empirical studies (Yaban et al., 2025) confirm that **autonomous motivation and self-efficacy** jointly foster resilience by supporting both persistence and adaptive disengagement when goals become unattainable. This dual function—balancing perseverance and flexibility—is now a central theme in behavioral adaptation research. Parallel work in environmental psychology links **response efficacy and adaptation to climate risk**, indicating that a sense of personal and collective agency remains a key predictor of proactive coping under systemic uncertainty.[^13][^14][^15]

Taken together, these 2025 studies mark a convergence across psychological and ecological domains: resilience to systemic collapse depends on emotionally grounded meaning-making, cognitively flexible awareness, socially embedded identity, temporal adaptability, and a dynamic sense of agency.
