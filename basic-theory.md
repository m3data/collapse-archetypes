# Theoretical Foundations of Collapse Archetypes

## 1. Introduction

Understanding the theoretical foundations behind collapse archetypes is essential for grounding these concepts in established psychological, sociological, and ecological frameworks. Theory provides a lens through which we can interpret human responses to collapse scenarios, offering insights into motivations, behaviors, and cultural narratives. This grounding enhances the robustness of archetype development and informs the design of questions that accurately capture the complexity of human attitudes and responses to systemic collapse.

| Opportunist Elite    | Elite Theory, Power Dynamics, Rational Choice Theory               | Leverages collapse for personal or group gain, often exacerbating inequalities and shaping systemic outcomes.   |

## 3. Sociological & Cultural Frames

Sociological theories provide context for how communities and cultures interpret and respond to collapse. Ulrich Beck’s Risk Society framework (1992) illustrates how modern societies are increasingly preoccupied with managing and distributing risks, including environmental and systemic collapse. Douglas and Wildavsky’s Cultural Theory of Risk emphasizes how cultural biases shape perceptions of risk and appropriate responses, highlighting the role of group values and social structures. Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt) offers insight into how differing moral intuitions underpin varied collapse narratives and political alignments. Additionally, myth and narrative identity play crucial roles in constructing collective meanings around collapse, influencing how societies remember, interpret, and mobilize around these events. These frameworks collectively illuminate the social dynamics that shape collapse archetypes and their associated behaviors.

## 4. Ecopsychological & Systems Frames

Ecopsychology integrates ecological and psychological perspectives, emphasizing the interconnectedness of humans and the natural world. Holling’s Adaptive Cycle describes phases of growth, accumulation, restructuring (collapse), and renewal within ecological and social systems, providing a dynamic model to understand collapse and recovery. Panarchy extends this by illustrating how systems at different scales interact through adaptive cycles, influencing resilience and transformation. Deep Ecology promotes an ecocentric worldview that values the intrinsic worth of all living beings, challenging anthropocentric collapse narratives. Indigenous and kincentric epistemologies emphasize relational worldviews that see humans as part of a web of life, fostering reciprocal responsibilities and long-term thinking. These perspectives enrich archetype development by embedding collapse responses within broader ecological and cultural contexts.

## 5. Implications for Question Design

The integration of these theories informs the development of question types and scoring dimensions that capture the multifaceted nature of collapse archetypes. Affective questions assess emotional tone, such as anxiety, hope, or denial, drawing on theories like Terror Management and Positive Psychology. Cognitive questions evaluate awareness and beliefs about collapse, informed by Motivated Reasoning and System Justification frameworks. Relational questions explore social identity, group affiliations, and worldview, leveraging Social Identity Theory, Moral Foundations, and Cultural Theory of Risk. Temporal questions examine time orientation and future expectations, reflecting insights from Adaptive Cycle and Panarchy models. Behavioral questions assess agency, coping strategies, and preparedness, guided by Self-Efficacy and Behavioral Adaptation theories. This theory-driven, multidimensional approach ensures assessments are nuanced, valid, and reflective of underlying psychological, sociological, and ecological processes.
